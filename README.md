<p>Mayuko emphasized that soft skills are essential, in addition to the tech skills, for colloboration and teamwork. Three elements of the syllabus that reflect this are
<ul>
<li>the use of group projects and colloboration;</li>
<li>the expectation of attendence and participation in all classes;</li>
<li>the encouragement to seek out other students for help and to help them in return;</li>
<li>and the use of peer review in assessment.</li></ul>
My experiences with coding and website development have reflected this. I tend to be on the content creation side of the website rather than the building part. With each new website I've worked on, I made sure to develop a strong relationship with the person who manages the website to both learn how to effectively edit its content but also to learn more about how I can create new and better ways of engaging folx through the design of the content. Part of building these relationships is a mutual exchange of information. Sometimes, I'm the one explaining a feature the web developers have never used. Part of these relationships also includes trusting that I won't accidently break anything and the developers are doing the best work they can to meet our needs.</p> 
<p>One of the other abilities Mayuko described was exploring the limitless possibilities.</p>
